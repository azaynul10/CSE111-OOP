The objective is to match three identical symbols (traditionally \"X\" or \"O\") in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, while preventing your opponent from doing the same. Players take turns placing their symbols on the grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw. A demo of the game is given at the end of the file.\n",
